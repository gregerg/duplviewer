duplviewer
==========

A web app for helping steam users view their friends' duplicate items. 

## Problem ##
Currently, trading can be a tedious task for more casual TF2 players. Browsing through friends' backpacks one by one to find a specific item they are looking for is time consuming. 

## Solution ##
Duplviewer allows users to view all duplicate items (items that might be available for trade) in a single view, so that they don't need to bounce between backpack views.

Later features may include various filters.
